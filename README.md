Menu script to facilitate making menus easier to create.  

`menus/compile.sh` does the work.  

Look here for docs on menus:

## Visual Studio Code support
There is a `./vscode/tasks.json` which is setup as the default build task. CTRL+SHIFT+B = build. Can build editing anywhere this way.  
There is a `./vscode/workspace.code-workspace` that points to the workspace root. Change this to yours. 

Enjoy
